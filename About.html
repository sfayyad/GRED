This website was created by the ja3l3s of Greenhills. Greenhills is an independant school of Ann Arbor. 
The data on the graphs is coming from the solar panels set up on our roof.
Teachers will be able to have their lessons uploaded and viewed by all who need them.
All lessons which you would like to upload need to be sent to us at ja3l3s@greenhillsschool.org
Feel free to contact us with any questions and how you may have used our data.
We'd love to see what you can do!
