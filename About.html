<h2 class="MakeBigGreen"><center>What is GRED</center></h2>
<h1 class="MakeBlack">	
GRED performs 24/7/365 collection, display and archiving of performance data from the school's rooftop renewable energy assets which include a 50W-peak wind turbine, a 5W solar array and a green roof. 
	It also gathers data from a rooftop weather station. The low power wind turbine and solar array are devoted entirely to student education; they are not tied into the school electric grid.
	The data is available on the charts page and is updated every day with the newest data.
	This website was created by the ja3l3s of Greenhills. Greenhills is an independant school of Ann Arbor. 
The data on the graphs is coming from the solar panels set up on our roof.
All lessons which you would like to upload need to be sent to us at ja3l3s@greenhillsschool.org
Feel free to contact us with any questions and how you may have used our data.
We'd love to see what you can do!
